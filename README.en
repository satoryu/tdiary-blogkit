-- tDiary Blogkit: How to run tDiary like blog. --

What's Blogkit?
---------------
tDiary Blogkit modifies tDiary. This modification enables 
tDiary to manage articles by topics, not daily.
tDiary with Blogkit is different from original one:

- Date has no meaning. It looks like 'serial number'.
- Each topic have last-modified.
- Top page has the 1st section of each topic(like summary).
- tDiary with Blogkit makes new topic number automatically when update.
- Blogkit adds new features: 'Recent Entries' and 'What's New'.

You can setup Blogkit without changing tDiary. It is only plugged-in.
